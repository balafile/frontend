4)What is server-side website programming?

Web browsers communicate with web servers using the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). 
When you click a link on a web page, submit a form, or run a search, an HTTP request is sent from your browser to the target server.

Introduction to Back-end development


Server-Side Logic: Backend developers work on the part of an application that resides on the server. 
They handle requests, process data, and generate dynamic content. 
Unlike frontend technologies that users directly interact with, backend technologies remain behind the scenes.

Responsibilities:

Databases: Backend developers work with databases to store and retrieve data.

Servers: They manage server configurations and handle requests from clients (such as browsers or mobile apps).

Business Logic: Backend code implements the core features and functionalities of an application.

Technologies:

Languages: Common backend languages include Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, and Node.js.

Frameworks: Backend frameworks (e.g., Django, Flask, Express) simplify development by providing pre-built components.

Databases: Backend developers interact with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.

Security and Scalability: Backend developers ensure data security, handle authentication, and optimize performance for scalability.

In summary, backend development focuses on making applications work efficiently by handling data, logic, and communication between the frontend and the server.

Backend Languages

Ideal for building real-time applications and APIs.
Works seamlessly with frontend JavaScript1.

PHP:
Open-source and widely used for web development.
Commonly paired with databases like MySQL.
Powers popular platforms like WordPress1.

Go (Golang):
Developed by Google.
Known for its performance, simplicity, and scalability.
Used in microservices, APIs, and cloud applications1.

API Introduction

An API (short for Application Programming Interface) is like a bridge that allows different software components to communicate and exchange data. 
Here are some key points about APIs:

Purpose: 
APIs enable applications to interact with each other. They define rules and protocols for communication.

Types of APIs:
Web APIs: These are commonly used over the internet. They allow web services to share data and functionality.

Cloud APIs: 
Services like Amazon S3 and EC2 provide APIs for storage and infrastructure.

Social Media APIs: Platforms like Facebook and Twitter offer APIs for developers to access their features.

Mobile APIs: Used in mobile app development.

How APIs Work:

APIs follow the HTTP protocol (the same one used for web browsing).

They have specific request and response structures.

For example, when you search for a location on a map app, it communicates with an API to fetch the relevant data.


Git:
Git is a version control system that manages and keeps track of your code. It allows you to:
Save snapshots of your changes (called commits) to your local repository.
Create branches to isolate changes for specific features, fixes, or experiments.
Track changes in your codebase efficiently.

Introduction to Git and GitHub

Git:
Git is a version control system that manages and keeps track of your code. It allows you to:
Save snapshots of your changes (called commits) to your local repository.
Create branches to isolate changes for specific features, fixes, or experiments.
Track changes in your codebase efficiently.

GitHub:
GitHub is a service that lets you host, share, and manage your code files on the internet.
It uses Git underneath and provides an online infrastructure for collaboration.
With GitHub, you can:
Create repositories (folders) to store your code and collaborate with others.
Manage issues, pull requests, and discussions related to your projects

What Is HTML?
HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
It defines the content and structure of web content, allowing you to create webpages.

Elements and Structure:
HTML consists of a series of elements that wrap different parts of content.
These elements define how content should appear or behave.
For example, you can use HTML tags to create headings, lists, images, links, and more.

Responsive web design (RWD) 

RWD is a web design approach that ensures web pages render well on all screen sizes and resolutions while maintaining good usability. 
It’s about creating websites that adapt gracefully to different devices, orientations, and platforms. Here are some key points:

Flexible Grids and Layouts:
RWD uses flexible grids and layouts to adjust content based on screen size.
Elements like columns, images, and text flow smoothly across different devices.

Responsive Images:
Images are optimized for various screen resolutions.
Different image sizes are served based on the user’s device.

DNS (Domain Name System) 

DNS is like the phonebook of the Internet. 
When you access websites using domain names (like nytimes.com), 
DNS translates those names into IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) that web browsers use to load resources.

Domain hosting connects domain names with hosting server IP addresses. 
Choosing the right hosting service impacts website speed and availability. 
Strong security measures are essential for protecting websites and visitors
