*) What are the different port numbers?

Internet protocols are a set of rules and conventions that govern how data is transmitted and received over the internet. 
They define the standards for communication between devices and networks. Here are some of the fundamental internet protocols:

1. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Used for transmitting web pages and content over the World Wide Web.

2. HTTPS (HTTP Secure): An extension of HTTP that adds a layer of security through encryption.

3. FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Used to transfer files between a client and a server on a network.

4. SSH (Secure Shell): Provides secure remote access to servers and network devices.

5. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): Used for sending email messages between email servers.

6. POP3 (Post Office Protocol, version 3): Retrieves email from a mail server to a local device.

7. IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol): Manages email on a mail server, allowing synchronization across devices.

8. DNS (Domain Name System): Resolves domain names to IP addresses, enabling human-readable web addresses.

9. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Ensures reliable, error-checked data transmission over IP networks.

10. UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Provides a connectionless, lightweight, and fast data transfer method.

11. IP (Internet Protocol): Routes data packets across networks and the internet.

12. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol): Used for error reporting and diagnostics in IP networks.

13. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol): Maps IP addresses to physical MAC addresses on a local network.

14. RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol): Used for streaming audio and video over the internet.

15. BGP (Border Gateway Protocol): Routes data between autonomous systems on the internet.

16. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.

17. SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol): Monitors and manages network devices and their functions.

18. Telnet: Provides remote access to network devices, often without encryption (not secure).

19. STMP (Simple Transfer Protocol): Used for sending text messages between devices.

20. NNTP (Network News Transfer Protocol): Transmits Usenet newsgroup articles.

21. SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security): Provides encryption and authentication for secure data transfer.

22. MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions): Extends email capabilities to handle multimedia and non-text attachments.

23. WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning): Enables collaborative editing and file management on web servers.

24. SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol): Used for device discovery and description on a network.

25. LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol): Accesses and manages directory services.

These protocols enable the functionality and communication that make the internet work. 
They facilitate data exchange, remote access, email, web browsing, and much more. Each protocol has its specific use cases and standards for implementation.

What is network port?


A network port is a communication endpoint in a computer network. It is a software construct that allows networked devices or applications to send and receive data.
Network ports are identified by a number, and each number is associated with a specific protocol or service.
These port numbers are 16-bit unsigned integers, which means they can range from 0 to 65,535The 
Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains the full list of port numbers and protocols assigned to them.

Top 25 most commonly used protocols are:
